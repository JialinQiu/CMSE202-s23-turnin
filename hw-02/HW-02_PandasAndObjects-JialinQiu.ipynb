    "&#9989; Similar to the iris dataset, where we classified iris flowers into specific species, we want to classify animal properties into animal classes. Let's say we want to tell fish and mammals apart. Make two scatter plots to cleanly separate the classes using attributes from your `zoo` dataset. Use different colors and different symbols for fish and mammals."
